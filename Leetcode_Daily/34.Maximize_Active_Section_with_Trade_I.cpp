//3499. Maximize Active Section with Trade I

/*
You are given a binary string s of length n, where:

'1' represents an active section.
'0' represents an inactive section.
You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in s. In a trade, you:

Convert a contiguous block of '1's that is surrounded by '0's to all '0's.
Afterward, convert a contiguous block of '0's that is surrounded by '1's to all '1's.
Return the maximum number of active sections in s after making the optimal trade.

Note: Treat s as if it is augmented with a '1' at both ends, forming t = '1' + s + '1'. The augmented '1's do not contribute to the final count.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "01"

Output: 1

Explanation:

Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "0100"

Output: 4

Explanation:

String "0100" → Augmented to "101001".
Choose "0100", convert "101001" → "100001" → "111111".
The final string without augmentation is "1111". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1000100"

Output: 7

Explanation:

String "1000100" → Augmented to "110001001".
Choose "000100", convert "110001001" → "110000001" → "111111111".
The final string without augmentation is "1111111". The maximum number of active sections is 7.
Example 4:

Input: s = "01010"

Output: 4

Explanation:

String "01010" → Augmented to "1010101".
Choose "010", convert "1010101" → "1000101" → "1111101".
The final string without augmentation is "11110". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n == s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'
